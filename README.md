## __Exploratory Data Analysis on Financial Inclusion Dataset__ ##


## _Description_ ##
Financial Inclusion is considered one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For instance, across East Africa only about 13.9% of the adult population have access to/use a commercial bank account
Access to bank accounts has always been seen as an indicator of financial inclusion and despite the rise of mobile money in Africa and the associated solutions, banks are still considered pivotal in facilitating access to financial services. 
This servicec enable households to save and enable payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness amongst other benefits. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

The business problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The solution will help provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in East Africa, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individuals’ financial outcomes
